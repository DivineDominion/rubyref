# Net::HTTPHeader

The HTTPHeader module defines methods for reading and writing HTTP headers.

It is used as a mixin by other classes, to provide hash-like access to HTTP
header values. Unlike raw hash access, HTTPHeader provides access via
case-insensitive keys. It also provides methods for accessing commonly-used
HTTP header values in more convenient formats.
