## Methods[](#methods)

Methods implement the functionality of your program. Here is a simple
method definition:


```ruby
def one_plus_one
  1 + 1
end
```

A method definition consists of the `def` keyword, a method name, the
body of the method, `return` value and the `end` keyword. When called
the method will execute the body of the method. This method returns `2`.

This section only covers defining methods. See also the [syntax
documentation on calling methods](methods-call.md).

### Method Names[](#method-names)

Method names may be one of the operators or must start a letter or a
character with the eight bit set. It may contain letters, numbers, an
`_` (underscore or low line) or a character with the eight bit set. The
convention is to use underscores to separate words in a multiword method
name:


```ruby
def method_name
  puts "use underscores to separate words"
end
```

Ruby programs must be written in a US-ASCII-compatible character set
such as UTF-8, ISO-8859-1 etc. In such character sets if the eight bit
is set it indicates an extended character. Ruby allows method names and
other identifiers to contain such characters. Ruby programs cannot
contain some characters like ASCII NUL (`\x00`).

The following are examples of valid Ruby methods:


```ruby
def hello
  "hello"
end

def こんにちは
  puts "means hello in Japanese"
end
```

Typically method names are US-ASCII compatible since the keys to type
them exist on all keyboards.

Method names may end with a `!` (bang or exclamation mark), a `?`
(question mark), or `=` (equals sign).

The bang methods (`!` at the end of the method name) are called and
executed just like any other method. However, by convention, a method
with an exclamation point or bang is considered dangerous. In Ruby's
core library the dangerous method implies that when a method ends with a
bang (`!`), it indicates that unlike its non-bang equivalent,
permanently modifies its receiver. Almost always, the Ruby core library
will have a non-bang counterpart (method name which does NOT end with
`!`) of every bang method (method name which does end with `!`) that
does not modify the receiver. This convention is typically true for the
Ruby core library but may or may not hold true for other Ruby libraries.

Methods that end with a question mark by convention return boolean, but
they may not always return just `true` or `false`. Often, they will
return an object to indicate a true value (or "truthy" value).

Methods that end with an equals sign indicate an assignment method. For
assignment methods, the return value is ignored and the arguments are
returned instead.

These are method names for the various Ruby operators. Each of these
operators accepts only one argument. Following the operator is the
typical use or name of the operator. Creating an alternate meaning for
the operator may lead to confusion as the user expects plus to add
things, minus to subtract things, etc. Additionally, you cannot alter
the precedence of the operators.

* `+`: add
* `-`: subtract
* `*`: multiply
* `**`: power
* `/`: divide
* `%`: modulus division, String#%
* `&`: AND
* `^`: XOR (exclusive OR)
* `>>`: right-shift
* `<<`: left-shift, append
* `==`: equal
* `!=`: not equal
* `===`: case equality. See `Object#===`
* `=~`: pattern match. (Not just for regular expressions)
* `!~`: does not match
* `<=>`: comparison aka spaceship operator. See Comparable
* `<`: less-than
* `<=`: less-than or equal
* `>`: greater-than
* `>=`: greater-than or equal

To define unary methods minus, plus, tilde and not (`!`) follow the
operator with an `@` as in `+@` or `!@`: 

```ruby
class C
  def -@
    puts "you inverted this object"
  end
end

obj = C.new

-obj # prints "you inverted this object"
```

Unary methods accept zero arguments.

Additionally, methods for element reference and assignment may be
defined: `[]` and `[]=` respectively. Both can take one or more
arguments, and element reference can take none.


```ruby
class C
  def [](a, b)
    puts a + b
  end

  def []=(a, b, c)
    puts a * b + c
  end
end

obj = C.new

obj[2, 3]     # prints "5"
obj[2, 3] = 4 # prints "10"
```

### Return Values[](#return-values)

By default, a method returns the last expression that was evaluated in
the body of the method. In the example above, the last (and only)
expression evaluated was the simple sum `1 + 1`. The `return` keyword
can be used to make it explicit that a method returns a value.


```ruby
def one_plus_one
  return 1 + 1
end
```

It can also be used to make a method return before the last expression
is evaluated.


```ruby
def two_plus_two
  return 2 + 2
  1 + 1  # this expression is never evaluated
end
```

Note that for assignment methods the return value will be ignored when
using the assignment syntax. Instead, the argument will be returned:


```ruby
def a=(value)
  return 1 + value
end

p(self.a = 5) # prints 5
```

The actual return value will be returned when invoking the method
directly:


```ruby
p send(:a=, 5) # prints 6
```

### Scope[](#scope)

The standard syntax to define a method:


```ruby
def my_method
  # ...
end
```

adds the method to a class. You can define an instance method on a
specific class with the `class` keyword:


```ruby
class C
  def my_method
    # ...
  end
end
```

A method may be defined on another object. You may define a "class
method" (a method that is defined on the class, not an instance of the
class) like this:


```ruby
class C
  def self.my_method
    # ...
  end
end
```

However, this is simply a special case of a greater syntactical power in
Ruby, the ability to add methods to any object. Classes are objects, so
adding class methods is simply adding methods to the Class object.

The syntax for adding a method to an object is as follows:


```ruby
greeting = "Hello"

def greeting.broaden
  self + ", world!"
end

greeting.broaden # returns "Hello, world!"
```

`self` is a keyword referring to the current object under consideration
by the compiler, which might make the use of `self` in defining a class
method above a little clearer. Indeed, the example of adding a `hello`
method to the class `String` can be rewritten thus:


```ruby
def String.hello
  "Hello, world!"
end
```

A method defined like this is called a "singleton method". `broaden`
will only exist on the string instance `greeting`. Other strings will
not have `broaden`.

### Overriding[](#overriding)

When Ruby encounters the `def` keyword, it doesn't consider it an error
if the method already exists: it simply redefines it. This is called
*overriding*. Rather like extending core classes, this is a potentially
dangerous ability, and should be used sparingly because it can cause
unexpected results. For example, consider this irb session:


```
>> "43".to_i
=> 43
>> class String
>>   def to_i
>>     42
>>   end
>> end
=> nil
>> "43".to_i
=> 42
```

This will effectively sabotage any code which makes use of the method
`String#to_i` to parse numbers from strings.

### Arguments[](#arguments)

A method may accept arguments. The argument list follows the method
name:


```ruby
def add_one(value)
  value + 1
end
```

When called, the user of the `add_one` method must provide an argument.
The argument is a local variable in the method body. The method will
then add one to this argument and return the value. If given `1` this
method will return `2`.

The parentheses around the arguments are optional:


```ruby
def add_one value
  value + 1
end
```

Multiple arguments are separated by a comma:


```ruby
def add_values(a, b)
  a + b
end
```

When called, the arguments must be provided in the exact order. In other
words, the arguments are positional.

Repeated argument names is syntax error. There is one exception: the
special name `_` to designate unused argument(s).


```
def some_method(x, y, x) # Syntax error
  # ...
end

def some_method(_, y, _) # OK
  # ...
end
```

This is useful for redefining methods, when client code expects a
particular calling convention.

#### Default Values[](#default-values)

Arguments may have default values:


```ruby
def add_values(a, b = 1)
  a + b
end
```

The default value does not need to appear first, but arguments with
defaults must be grouped together. This is ok:


```ruby
def add_values(a = 1, b = 2, c)
  a + b + c
end
```

This will raise a SyntaxError:


```
def add_values(a = 1, b, c = 1)
  a + b + c
end
```

#### Array Decomposition[](#array-decomposition)

You can decompose (unpack or extract values from) an Array using extra
parentheses in the arguments:


```ruby
def my_method((a, b))
  p a: a, b: b
end

my_method([1, 2])
```

This prints:


```ruby
{:a=>1, :b=>2}
```

If the argument has extra elements in the Array they will be ignored:


```ruby
def my_method((a, b))
  p a: a, b: b
end

my_method([1, 2, 3])
```

This has the same output as above.

You can use a `*` to collect the remaining arguments. This splits an
Array into a first element and the rest:


```ruby
def my_method((a, *b))
  p a: a, b: b
end

my_method([1, 2, 3])
```

This prints:


```ruby
{:a=>1, :b=>[2, 3]}
```

The argument will be decomposed if it responds to `#to_ary`. You should
only define `#to_ary` if you can use your object in place of an Array.

Use of the inner parentheses only uses one of the sent arguments. If the
argument is not an Array it will be assigned to the first argument in
the decomposition and the remaining arguments in the decomposition will
be `nil`: 

```ruby
def my_method(a, (b, c), d)
  p a: a, b: b, c: c, d: d
end

my_method(1, 2, 3)
```

This prints:


```ruby
{:a=>1, :b=>2, :c=>nil, :d=>3}
```

You can nest decomposition arbitrarily:


```ruby
def my_method(((a, b), c))
  # ...
end
```

#### Array/Hash Argument[](#arrayhash-argument)

Prefixing an argument with `*` causes any remaining arguments to be
converted to an Array:


```ruby
def gather_arguments(*arguments)
  p arguments
end

gather_arguments 1, 2, 3 # prints [1, 2, 3]
```

The array argument must be the last positional argument, it must appear
before any keyword arguments.

The array argument will capture a Hash as the last entry if a hash was
sent by the caller after all positional arguments.


```ruby
gather_arguments 1, a: 2 # prints [1, {:a=>2}]
```

However, this only occurs if the method does not declare any keyword
arguments.


```ruby
def gather_arguments_keyword(*positional, keyword: nil)
 p positional: positional, keyword: keyword
end

gather_arguments_keyword 1, 2, three: 3
#=> raises: unknown keyword: three (ArgumentError)
```

Also, note that a bare `*` can be used to ignore arguments:


```ruby
def ignore_arguments(*)
end
```

#### Keyword Arguments[](#keyword-arguments)

Keyword arguments are similar to positional arguments with default
values:


```ruby
def add_values(first: 1, second: 2)
  first + second
end
```

Arbitrary keyword arguments will be accepted with `**`: 

```ruby
def gather_arguments(first: nil, **rest)
  p first, rest
end

gather_arguments first: 1, second: 2, third: 3
# prints 1 then {:second=>2, :third=>3}
```

When calling a method with keyword arguments the arguments may appear in
any order. If an unknown keyword argument is sent by the caller an
ArgumentError is raised.

When mixing keyword arguments and positional arguments, all positional
arguments must appear before any keyword arguments.

It is possible to define a keyword argument with name that is not
acceptable for a variable name, like `class` or `next` (keywords). In
this case, argument's value can be obtained via
[Binding](../builtin/core.md#binding).


```ruby
def html_tag(name, class:)
  # Will fail with SyntaxError
  # puts class

  # Works
  puts binding.local_variable_get('class')
end
```

### Block Argument[](#block-argument)

The block argument is indicated by `&` and must come last:


```ruby
def my_method(&my_block)
  my_block.call(self)
end
```

Most frequently the block argument is used to pass a block to another
method:


```ruby
def each_item(&block)
  @items.each(&block)
end
```

If you are only going to call the block and will not otherwise
manipulate it or send it to another method using `yield` without an
explicit block parameter is preferred. This method is equivalent to the
first method in this section:


```ruby
def my_method
  yield self
end
```

There is also a performance benefit to using yield over a calling a
block parameter. When a block argument is assigned to a variable a Proc
object is created which holds the block. When using yield this Proc
object is not created.

If you only need to use the block sometimes you can use Proc.new to
create a proc from the block that was passed to your method. See
Proc.new for further details.

### Exception Handling[](#exception-handling)

Methods have an implied exception handling block so you do not need to
use `begin` or `end` to handle exceptions. This:


```ruby
def my_method
  begin
    # code that may raise an exception
  rescue
    # handle exception
  end
end
```

May be written as:


```ruby
def my_method
  # code that may raise an exception
rescue
  # handle exception
end
```

If you wish to rescue an exception for only part of your method, use
`begin` and `end`. For more details see the page on [exception
handling](exceptions.md).

### Method definition as an expression[](#method-definition-as-an-expression)

`def` (method definition) is an *expression* returning the name of the
defined method. This feature is mostly useful for method decoration:


```ruby
# Ruby's standard visibility statement
private def some_private_method
  # ...
end

# Decorating with third-party library for memoizing (caching) method value
memoize def some_expensive_method
  # ...
end
```

`private` and `memoize` above are just method calls, receiving the
result of `def` (method name to make private/cached) as their argument.



#### `alias`[](#alias)

The `alias` keyword is most frequently used to alias methods. When
aliasing a method, you can use either its name or a symbol:


```ruby
alias new_name old_name
alias :new_name :old_name
```

For methods, `Module#alias_method` can often be used instead of `alias`.

You can also use `alias` to alias global variables:


```ruby
$old = 0

alias $new $old

p $new # prints 0
```

You may use `alias` in any scope.

#### `undef`[](#undef)

The `undef` keyword prevents the current class from responding to calls
to the named methods.


```ruby
undef my_method
```

You may use symbols instead of method names:


```ruby
undef :my_method
```

You may undef multiple methods:


```ruby
undef method1, method2
```

You may use `undef` in any scope. See also `Module#undef_method`
